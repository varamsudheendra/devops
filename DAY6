Day-6 | Linux & Shell Scripting: Your DevOps Foundation 🐧
-

### 1. Understanding Operating Systems (OS) 🤔

An **Operating System (OS)** acts as a bridge or medium for communication between your software applications (like Jenkins, office tools, Java/Python) and the computer's hardware (CPU, RAM, I/O, hard disk).

* **Analogy:** Think of an OS like the pre-installed software (e.g., Windows) on a new laptop that allows you to run applications directly on its hardware.
* **Communication Flow:**
    1.  User interacts with an application.
    2.  Application sends requests to the OS.
    3.  OS sends requests to the hardware.
    4.  Hardware processes and sends responses back to the OS.
    5.  OS sends responses back to the application.
    6.  Application provides information back to the user.
* The OS is considered the "core" or "heart" of the system. ❤️

### 2. Why Linux is Popular in Software Development 💡

While many are familiar with Windows, Linux is predominantly used (80-90% of the time) in production, staging, and development environments in the software industry. Here's why:

* **Free and Open Source:** Unlike Windows (proprietary), Linux is freeware and open-source, allowing anyone to use and modify it. 🆓
* **Security:** Linux is inherently very secure and generally doesn't require antivirus software, unlike Windows. 🛡️
* **Distributions (Distros):** Linux offers many versions like CentOS, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Alpine, and Debian. You can choose based on comfort, with Ubuntu and CentOS being popular free options. 🐧
* **Speed and Stability:** Linux is known for being very fast and stable, rarely crashing. This is vital for applications running on production systems, ensuring quick request processing. ⚡

### 3. Linux Operating System Architecture (Simplified) 🏗️

A simplified view of how Linux is structured:

* **Kernel:** The "heart" of the Linux OS. Its main job is to facilitate communication between hardware and software.
    * **Four Primary Responsibilities of the Kernel:**
        1.  Device management
        2.  Memory management
        3.  Process management
        4.  Handling system calls
* **System Libraries:** Located above the kernel, these libraries perform tasks requested by the user and then forward them to the kernel (e.g., `Libc`). 📚
* **Compilers, User Processes, and System Software:** The outermost layer where compilers (for Java, Python), user-specific processes, and system-related software reside. 🖥️

### 4. Fundamentals of Shell Scripting 💬

**Shell** is how you interact or "talk" to your Linux operating system.

* **Why Shell?** In professional software organizations, servers often don't have a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Shell commands allow you to perform all necessary tasks (like creating files, navigating folders, running programs) via the command line. ⌨️
* **Bash:** Bash is a widely recommended and popular shell. The commands you learn are generally consistent across different Linux distributions.

### 5. Essential Linux Shell Commands (Practical) 🛠️

Here are some fundamental commands demonstrated in the video, crucial for daily DevOps tasks:

* `PWD` (Present Working Directory): Shows your current location in the file system. Always use this first when logging into a server. 📁
* `LS` (List): Lists files and folders in the current directory.
    * `LS -LTR`: Provides detailed information (permissions, owner, group, size, timestamp, and if it's a directory or file). 📜
* `CD` (Change Directory): Used to navigate between directories.
    * `CD directory_name`: Moves into a specific directory.
    * `CD ..`: Moves up one directory level.
    * `CD ../..`: Moves up two directory levels.
    * `CD /path/to/directory`: Moves to a specific absolute path. 🚶‍♀️
* `TOUCH`: Creates an empty file. `touch filename` 📄
* `VI`: A powerful text editor to create and write content into files.
    * `VI filename`: Opens/creates a file.
    * Press `Esc` then `I` to enter **INSERT mode** for writing.
    * After writing, press `Esc` then `:wq` (write and quit) to save and exit. ✍️
* `CAT`: Prints the contents of a file to the terminal. `cat filename` 📖
* `MKDIR` (Make Directory): Creates a new directory. `mkdir directory_name` 📂
* `RM` (Remove): Deletes files. `rm filename` 🗑️
    * `RM -R`: Deletes directories (recursively). `rm -r directory_name` ⚠️ (Use with caution!)

### 6. Monitoring System Performance (Crucial for DevOps) 📊

These commands are vital for checking the health and resource usage of your Linux systems:

* `FREE`: Checks memory usage. `free -m` shows memory in MB. 🧠
* `NPROC`: Shows the number of CPUs. ⚡
* `DF -H`: Checks disk size and usage in a human-readable format. 💾
* `TOP`: The most popular command to monitor CPU, memory, disk, and running processes in real-time from a single interface. This is a very common interview question! 📈
